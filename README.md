# personal-projects
This is the repository that members can be able to display their final products for their personal products and showcase them.

You add personal projects per the year that they did the project and you add it as a submodule.

We add projects as submodules because we want to keep a link to the up to date repos, but want to acknowledge that the student worked on this project as well.

### How to add projects
